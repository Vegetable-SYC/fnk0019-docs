##############################################################################

In this chapter, we'll focus on the WiFi infrastructure for ESP8266. 

ESP8266 has 3 different WiFi operating modes: station mode, AP mode and AP+station mode. All WiFi programming projects must be configured with WiFi operating mode before using WiFi, otherwise WiFi cannot be used.

Station mode
----------------------------

When ESP8266 selects Station mode, it acts as a WiFi client. It can connect to the router network and communicate with other devices on the router via WiFi connection. As shown below, the PC is connected to the router, and if ESP8266 wants to communicate with the PC, it needs to be connected to the router.

Code
========================

Move the program folder "Freenove_Ultimate_Starter_Kit_for_ESP8266/Python/Python_Codes" to disk(D) in advance with the path of "D:/Micropython_Codes".

Open "Thonny", click "This computer" -> "D:" -> "Micropython_Codes" -> "20.1_Station_mode" and double click "Station_mode.py".

Because the names and passwords of routers in various places are different, before the Code runs, users need to enter the correct router’s name and password in the box as shown in the illustration above.

After making sure the router name and password are entered correctly, compile and upload codes to ESP8266, wait for ESP8266 to connect to your router and print the IP address assigned by the router to ESP8266 in "Shell".

Project AP mode

Component List & Circuit
================================

Component List & Circuit are the same as in Section 20.1.

Component knowledge

AP mode
--------------------------------

When ESP8266 selects AP mode, it creates a hotspot network that is separate from the Internet and waits for other WiFi devices to connect. As shown in the figure below, ESP8266 is used as a hotspot. If a mobile phone or PC wants to communicate with ESP8266, it must be connected to the hotspot of ESP8266. Only after a connection is established with ESP8266 can they communicate.

Before the Code runs, you can make any changes to the AP name and password for ESP8266 in the box as shown in the illustration above. Of course, you can leave it alone by default.

Click "Run current script", open the AP function of ESP8266 and print the access point information.

Turn on the WiFi scanning function of your phone, and you can see the ssid_AP on ESP8266, which is called "WiFi_Name" in this Code. You can enter the password "12345678" to connect it or change its AP name and password by modifying Code.

AP+Station mode
-------------------------------

In addition to AP mode and station mode, ESP8266 can also use AP mode and station mode at the same time. This mode contains the functions of the previous two modes. Turn on ESP8266's station mode, connect it to the router network, and it can communicate with the Internet via the router. At the same time, turn on its AP mode to create a hotspot network. Other WiFi devices can choose to connect to the router network or the hotspot network to communicate with ESP8266.
